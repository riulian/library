## 🤨 What does it do ?

We want to help librarians with their job using technology 👩🏻‍💻.\
Focus on the backend, we will not measure the frontend side.

**Features to do:**
- Add a new book
- Add a user
- Rent a book
- Return a book
- Show books that I have rented with a status ( user view )
- Show all books with a status (library view)
- Leave an instruction on how to run tests and a short description about your solution.

**Additional but not required**
- authorization
- list of my books( after sign in)
- If you want to be a fullstack you can show us the frontend skills but if you aim for backend don't do it.
